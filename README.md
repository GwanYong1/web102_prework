## Notes

I struggled a lot trying to figure out how to get the game cards to be visible on the website because I kept encounting errors in my javascript code. Furthermore, it was challenging to format the fonts to make the game cards look good and to have the image show up with the correct size that fits inside the game card. Once I was able to figure this out, all of the other challenges were a lot more manageable.
